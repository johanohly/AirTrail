# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in this project, please report it
by [creating a new security advisory](https://github.com/johanohly/AirTrail/security/advisories/new).

These are only viewable by the project maintainers until they are resolved, at which point they will be made public and
credit will be given to the reporter.
