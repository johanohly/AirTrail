Before you start the installation, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

## Software

- <Link href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker</Link>
- <Link href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">Docker Compose</Link>

## Hardware

AirTrail requires very little hardware resources to run. The following are the recommended minimum requirements:

- 2 CPU cores
- 2 GB RAM
- 10 GB disk space

The above requirements are for a small-scale deployment. For larger deployments, you may need to increase the resources accordingly.

## Operating System

AirTrail has only been tested on Linux. We recommend using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or higher.
