import Link from '@/components/Link.astro';

:::caution[EXPERIMENTAL]
This method is experimental and may not work on all systems. For a more reliable installation, we recommend using
the [Docker Compose](/docs/install/docker-compose) method.
:::

## Requirements

See the software [requirements](/docs/install/requirements).

## Usage

Run the following command in your terminal to install AirTrail:

```bash
bash <(curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohanOhly/AirTrail/main/scripts/install.sh)
```

This will

- create a new directory called `airtrail` in your current working directory
- inside it, it will download
  the <Link href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohanOhly/AirTrail/main/docker/production/compose.yml'>docker-compose.yml</Link>
  and <Link href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohanOhly/AirTrail/main/.env.example'>.env</Link> files from the repository
- start the AirTrail services using Docker Compose

:::tip
After the installation is complete, you should follow the [post-installation steps](/docs/install/post-installation).
