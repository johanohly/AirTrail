AeroDataBox is an alternative flight lookup provider for AirTrail flight number lookups.

## Why Use AeroDataBox?

AirTrail defaults to adsbdb (free, no setup) but it has limits:

- Limited flight data coverage
- No ability to search flights by date
- Less reliable data for some routes and airlines

AeroDataBox adds:

- **Broader flight data coverage** and accuracy
- **Date search capability** - look up flights by date
- **Departure and arrival times** for matching flights
- **Aircraft and airline details** when AeroDataBox returns them
- **AeroDataBox history limit** - results are typically available for flights within the last year

AeroDataBox provides a free tier that should be enough for most users.

## Date Search

With AeroDataBox enabled, you can:

- Enter a flight number with a specific date (using the existing "Departure" field)
- Look up flights that occurred weeks or months ago
- Get more accurate departure and arrival times for past flights
- See aircraft and airline details when AeroDataBox provides them

## Setup

- Optional by default: The integration is disabled unless you provide an API key.
- Where to set the key:
  - In the app (admins only): Settings → Integrations → "AeroDataBox API Key".
  - Or via environment variable: set `INTEGRATIONS_AERO_DATA_BOX_KEY` and restart the server.
- Server‑side only usage: The API key is kept on the server and never exposed to regular users. For non‑admin users the client never receives the key.
- Admin visibility only: The key is only ever sent to the frontend when requested by an authenticated admin (used to prefill the field in Settings). Requests by non‑admins are rejected.
- Proxied lookups: All flight number lookups are performed by the server, which adds the API key in the request to AeroDataBox. The browser never talks to AeroDataBox directly.

### What happens without a key?

- Flight lookup features that rely on AeroDataBox are unavailable until a key is configured.
- The rest of AirTrail continues to work normally.
