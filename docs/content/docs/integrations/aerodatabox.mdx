AeroDataBox is an enhanced flight lookup provider that can replace the default **adsbdb** service used by AirTrail for flight number lookups.

## Why Use AeroDataBox?

By default, AirTrail uses adsbdb for flight number lookups, which is free and requires no configuration. However, adsbdb has several limitations:

- Limited flight data coverage
- No ability to search flights by date
- Less reliable data for some routes and airlines

AeroDataBox provides significant improvements:

- **Much better flight data coverage** and accuracy
- **Date search capability** - you can look up historical flights by specifying a date

AeroDataBox provides a free tier that should be enough for most users.

## Date Search Feature

One of the key advantages of AeroDataBox is the ability to search for flights by date. When using AeroDataBox as your flight lookup provider, you can:

- Enter a flight number along with a specific date (uses the existing "Departure" field) to find historical flight information
- Look up flights that occurred weeks or months ago
- Get more accurate departure and arrival times for past flights

This is particularly useful when logging flights retroactively or when you need to look up flight details from a previous trip.

- Optional by default: The integration is disabled unless you provide an API key.
- Where to set the key:
  - In the app (admins only): Settings → Integrations → "AeroDataBox API Key".
  - Or via environment variable: set `INTEGRATIONS_AERO_DATA_BOX_KEY` and restart the server.
- Server‑side only usage: The API key is kept on the server and never exposed to regular users. For non‑admin users the client never receives the key.
- Admin visibility only: The key is only ever sent to the frontend when requested by an authenticated admin (used to prefill the field in Settings). Requests by non‑admins are rejected.
- Proxied lookups: All flight number lookups are performed by the server, which adds the API key in the request to AeroDataBox. The browser never talks to AeroDataBox directly.

### What happens without a key?

- Flight lookup features that rely on AeroDataBox are unavailable until a key is configured.
- The rest of AirTrail continues to work normally.
