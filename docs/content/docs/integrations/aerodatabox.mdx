title: AeroDataBox
---

AeroDataBox allows AirTrail to look up flight numbers and get additional information about flights filled-in automatically when adding a flight.
AeroDataBox provides a free tier that should be enough for most users.
Get an API key here: [https://rapidapi.com/aedbx-aedbx/api/aerodatabox](https://rapidapi.com/aedbx-aedbx/api/aerodatabox).

- Optional by default: The integration is disabled unless you provide an API key.
- Where to set the key:
  - In the app (admins only): Settings → Integrations → "AeroDataBox API Key".
  - Or via environment variable: set `INTEGRATIONS_AERO_DATA_BOX_KEY` and restart the server.
- Server‑side only usage: The API key is kept on the server and never exposed to regular users. For non‑admin users the client never receives the key.
- Admin visibility only: The key is only ever sent to the frontend when requested by an authenticated admin (used to prefill the field in Settings). Requests by non‑admins are rejected.
- Proxied lookups: All flight number lookups are performed by the server, which adds the API key in the request to AeroDataBox. The browser never talks to AeroDataBox directly.

### What happens without a key?
- Flight lookup features that rely on AeroDataBox are unavailable until a key is configured.
- The rest of AirTrail continues to work normally.
