title: Updating
---

You can update AirTrail to the latest version by following these steps.

## Docker Compose

To update your Docker Compose installation, run the following command in the directory where the `docker-compose.yml`
and `.env` files are located:

```bash title="Update AirTrail"
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

## Manual Installation

<Callout>
  Before updating, it is recommended to back up your database in case something
  goes wrong.
</Callout>

Updating a manually installed version of AirTrail is a bit more involved. You need to pull the latest changes from the
repository, install the dependencies, rebuild the app, and run the database migrations.

Before you start, make sure you have turned off the old version of AirTrail.

### Pull the Latest Changes

First, navigate to the directory where you installed AirTrail and pull the latest changes from the repository:

```bash title="Pull the latest changes"
git pull
```

### Install Dependencies

Next, install the dependencies:

```bash title="Install the dependencies"
bun install
```

### Build the App

Now, build the app:

```bash title="Build the app"
bun run build
```

### Run Database Migrations

Finally, run the database migrations:

<Callout type="warn">
  Make sure you ran the database migrations after the initial installation as
  well, or you risk losing data when updating.
</Callout>

```bash title="Run the database migrations"
bun run db:migrate-deploy
```
