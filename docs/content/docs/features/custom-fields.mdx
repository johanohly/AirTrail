title: Custom Fields
---

Custom fields let you track additional data on your flights beyond what AirTrail provides out of the box.
They are configured globally by an admin and apply to all flights.

## Managing custom fields

To manage custom fields, go to **Settings > Custom Fields**. From here you can create, edit, reorder, and delete field definitions.

Each field definition has the following properties:

- **Key**: A unique identifier used internally (lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores).
- **Label**: The display name shown in the UI.
- **Type**: The kind of data the field stores (see [Field types](#field-types) below).
- **Required**: Whether the field must be filled in before saving a flight.
- **Default value**: An optional value that is pre-filled when editing a flight that doesn't have a saved value for the field.

## Field types

| Type       | Description                              | Stored value             |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Short text | Single-line text input                   | String                   |
| Long text  | Multi-line textarea                      | String                   |
| Number     | Numeric input                            | Number                   |
| Boolean    | Toggle switch                            | `true` / `false`         |
| Date       | Date picker                              | Date string (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| Select     | Dropdown from a list of options          | String (selected option) |
| Airport    | Airport picker (same as the flight form) | Airport object           |
| Airline    | Airline picker                           | Airline object           |
| Aircraft   | Aircraft picker                          | Aircraft object          |

## Using custom fields

When adding or editing a flight, click the **sliders icon** next to the Save button to open the custom fields modal.
Any fields with default values are pre-filled automatically.

### Unsaved defaults

When editing an existing flight, if new custom fields have been added since the flight was created, the modal shows an amber badge on the trigger button and a warning inside:

> Some fields below are showing default values that haven't been saved on this flight yet. Saving the flight will apply these defaults.

This ensures you're aware that saving the flight will persist those default values.

## Validation

Required fields are validated before the flight can be saved. If any required custom fields are empty, the modal opens automatically with per-field error messages.

Text fields support optional validation rules (min/max length, regex pattern). Number fields support min/max value constraints.

## Export and import

Custom field values are included in the **JSON export**. Entity-type fields (airport, airline, aircraft) are expanded to their full objects, matching the format used for the flight's own airport and airline data.

  Custom field values are exported for reference but are **not restored** when
  re-importing into AirTrail. The field definitions and their values would need
  to be recreated manually after an import.

Custom fields are not included in the CSV export.
