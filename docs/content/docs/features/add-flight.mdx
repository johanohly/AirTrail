## Date and Time

<Callout title="Timezones">
  Times are represented in the local timezone of the airport. So if you are
  flying from New York to London, the departure time should be entered in
  Eastern Time and the arrival time in Greenwich Mean Time.
</Callout>

The departure date is required, the rest are optional.
If a arrival time is entered without an arrival date, the date will be assumed to be the same as the departure date.

## Origin and Destination

These fields are required.
Start typing the name of the airport and select the correct one from the list.
For the most consistent results, search using the ICAO or IATA code.

## From flight number

If you have a flight number, you can enter it at the top.
Clicking "Search" will try to fill in the origin, destination, and airline fields for you.

### Flight Data Providers

By default, AirTrail uses **adsbdb** for flight number lookups. While adsbdb is free and doesn't require configuration, it has some limitations:

- Limited flight data coverage
- No ability to search flights by date
- Less reliable data for some routes and airlines

For much better results and additional features, you can configure **AeroDataBox** as your flight lookup provider instead. AeroDataBox offers:

- More comprehensive flight data
- Better accuracy and coverage
- **Ability to search by date**

To set up AeroDataBox, see the [AeroDataBox integration documentation](/docs/integrations/aerodatabox).
