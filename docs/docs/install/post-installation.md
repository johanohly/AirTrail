# Post Installation

Right after you have AirTrail up and running, you should follow the steps below to get started.

:::tip
If you followed the installation guide, you can access the AirTrail application by visiting `http://<host-ip-address>:3000` in your web browser.

## Register the owner user

The first thing you should do is to create the owner user. This user will have full access to the AirTrail application.
When you visit the AirTrail application for the first time, you will be guided through the owner user registration process.

## Create other users

If you have friends or family members who want to use AirTrail to track their flights as well, you can create user accounts for them.

To create a new user, go to the settings page, and click on the "Users" tab. Enter the required information and click on the "Add User" button.

## Add flights

Start adding flights to your account to see the map slowly fill up with your flight paths. You can add flights manually or [import them](/docs/features/import) from various sources.
