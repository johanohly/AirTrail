# Portainer

Portainer is a lightweight management UI which allows you to easily manage your Docker instances.

To install Portainer, you can follow the [Official documentation](https://docs.portainer.io/start/install-ce/server/docker).

## Create a stack

Head over to the **Stacks** section in the Portainer UI and click on **Add stack**.

Fill in the following details:

- **Name**: Give your stack a name, for example `AirTrail`.
- **Web editor**: Copy and paste the content from the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohanOhly/AirTrail/main/docker-compose.yml) file.
  - Replace all instances of `.env` with `stack.env`
    <img src={require('./img/portainer-stack-env.png').default} width="80%" alt="Replace .env with stack.env" />
- **Environment variables**: Go into "Advanced mode" and copy-paste the contents of [.env.example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohanOhly/AirTrail/main/.env.example) into the text area.
  - Change the `ORIGIN` to the URL that you will be accessing your AirTrail instance from.
  - Change the `DB_PASSWORD` to a secure password. Optionally, change other database settings.

Click **Deploy the stack**.

After deploying the stack, you should follow the [Post Installation](/docs/install/post-installation) steps.
